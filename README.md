## Features of the web application:
* Add a task
* Check the task if completed
* Delete the task
* Displays the total number of pending tasks at the bottom
## Implementation:
The app is implemented using pure HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. The app uses Font Awesome for icon design. 

## Note:
The entered tasks are available only till the session ends. Once you restart the application or browser the tasks are deleted.
